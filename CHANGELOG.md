# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [3.2.1] - 2021-02-21

### Added
- New constant "ce_timeline.layout.templateName" available. You don't need to change this. But you can choose now if the extension renders the "Default" Layout of fluid_styled_content, or the built-in layout "TimelineCustom" wich is the current one you are probably using. If you use the "bootstrap_package" for TYPO3, I recommend to switch to "Timeline" here, in order to have all the background styles etc. available.
- Added "Access" tab to timeline entries, so that you can define starting time and ending time to your entries
- Several code cleanups
- Created CHANGELOG file and let's go on from here!
